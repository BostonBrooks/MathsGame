This code uses pools, expanding arrays of objects that can be quickly
accessed/deleted without having to go through malloc() and free().
Every object in a pool comes with an integer address so the session
can be saved and resored without losing track of object pointers.

The code stores a list of function calls on a stack to allow undo-ing
of commands, and annother stack allowing redo-ing of commands.

The code stores a queue of commands that can be stepped through to replay
every command made from the starting point.
